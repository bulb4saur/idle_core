# A very simple core of idle game

## What works?

* World initialization with very basic "tick" system that updates the player every "tick" and saves player state.

## How to run?

First of all, you will need a packaging tool called [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).After that Just `cd` into the `idle_core` directory and run

```ssh
poetry install
```

After that you can run it via

```ssh
poetry run python idle_core
```

or

```ssh
python run idle_core
```
